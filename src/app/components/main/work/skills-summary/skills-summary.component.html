                    Angular is my go-to front-end framework. I've worked on several projects using it. Can
                    you guess this site's framework?
                    Of course, my TypeScript/ JavaScript skills are on point too.

                    I began my coding journey with C# - its object-oriented vibe just clicked. It's been my main
                    squeeze
                    ever since. I've
                    crafted back-ends, tinkered with data access layers, business logic, and APIs, and even dabbled
                    in
                    Windows desktop apps.
                    Oh, and I've nailed the 'Hello World' console app, of course.

                    C# was my entry ticket to the .NET universe. Desktop development immersed me in .NET Framework,
                    while my web endeavors
                    spanned .NET Core and the contemporary .NET 6.

                    Data is versatile and can be manipulated in countless ways. I've honed my skills using SQL Server,
                    crafting a variety of
                    queries, from straightforward SELECTs to complex JOIN operations. And yes, I've even dared to DROP
                    DATABASE (but only on
                    my local machine).

            Some other languages, tools, technologies, etc. I've picked up along the way: Auth0, Dart, Entity Framework,
            Flutter, Git,
            HTML/CSS/SCSS, MySQL, NPM, NuGet, PHP, Postman, SQL Server Profiler, SSMS, Swagger UI, unit tests, Visual
            Studio, VS
            Code. And probably a couple more I've forgotten to mention.
