                    <p class="description">I started my software development career at a software consultancy company.
                        It allowed me to work on a number of
                        different projects, some that were interesting and others that were a tad less exciting. This
                        experience helped me learn
                        what I enjoy most about software development, as well as how to interact with multiple teams and
                        personalities.</p>

                    <p class="description">In the build up to Covid I was persuing a position at a new company and made
                        the move one month into it. They were
                        chaotic times and initially I was rather anxious making a job change in such uncertain times.
                        Ultimately it paid off and
                        I thouroughly enjoyed my time here. I had some great leadership and worked with some very
                        talented devs. I spent my
                        three years here fully remote which meant I had to hold myself accountable and keep good lines
                        of communication with the
                        rest of the team. Thankfully, something which I don't struggle with.</p>

                        they didn't stop to
                        think if they should.
                        Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer
                        virus. We gotta burn the
                        rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw
                        up this planet enough,
                        they won't want it anymore!</p>
